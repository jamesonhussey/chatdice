          <h2 id="personal-info">What Information Should You Never Share?</h2>
          
          <p>The number one rule: <strong>never share personal information</strong>. It sounds obvious, but when you're deep in a good conversation, it's easy to let things slip. Keep these to yourself:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Your full name (stick to first names or nicknames)</li>
            <li>Where you live, go to school, or work</li>
            <li>Phone numbers, emails, or social media handles</li>
            <li>Any financial information</li>
            <li>Photos or videos that show your face or location</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The whole point of anonymous chat is that you don't need to share any of this stuff to have a great conversation.</p>

          <h2 id="red-flags">What Are the Red Flags to Watch For?</h2>

          <p>Most people on these platforms just want to chat, but you should still watch out for warning signs:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Someone pushing hard for your personal info or trying to get you off the platform</li>
            <li>Unsolicited sexual messages or photo requests</li>
            <li>Sad stories that end with asking for money</li>
            <li>Stories that sound made up or too perfect</li>
            <li>Guilt-tripping or emotional manipulation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If any of this happens, just leave. You don't owe anyone an explanation.</p>

          <h2 id="safety-features">How Do Platform Safety Features Help?</h2>

          <p>Good chat platforms have safety tools built in. On ChatDice, you can:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Report users who are being inappropriate</li>
            <li>Skip to a new conversation whenever you want</li>
            <li>Trust that messages are moderated for safety</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="trust-instincts">When Should You Trust Your Instincts?</h2>

          <p>If something feels weird, it probably is. You don't need a specific reason to leave a conversation. Just leave.</p>

          <p>Some obvious times to bail:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>They're asking way too many personal questions</li>
            <li>You feel pressured into something</li>
            <li>The conversation gets sexual when you didn't want that</li>
            <li>Their story has holes in it</li>
            <li>You're just not having fun</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="stay-on-platform">Why Should You Stay On the Platform?</h2>

          <p>A common trick is to quickly move the conversation to WhatsApp, Instagram, or Telegram. Avoid this because:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>You lose the platform's safety features</li>
            <li>It usually leads to them asking for more personal info</li>
            <li>It's harder to cut contact later if things get weird</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you genuinely vibe with someone, you can keep chatting right here. There's no rush to move elsewhere.</p>

          <h2 id="digital-footprint">How Do You Protect Your Digital Footprint?</h2>

          <p>Even without sharing direct info, small details can add up. Be careful about mentioning:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Local events or specific places you go</li>
            <li>Unique details about your school or job</li>
            <li>Unusual hobbies that could identify you</li>
            <li>Stuff you've posted on other platforms</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="take-breaks">Why Should You Take Breaks?</h2>

          <p>If you hit a string of bad conversations, step away for a bit. It's normal to feel drained after dealing with annoying or creepy people. The site will be here when you come back.</p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

          <p>Random chat can be a great way to meet interesting people and have conversations you wouldn't normally have. Just use common sense, trust your gut, and don't be afraid to leave any conversation that doesn't feel right.</p>

          <p>Stay safe and have fun!</p>
