          <h2 id="smile-today">1. "What's something that made you smile today?"</h2>
          
          <p>Way better than "how are you?" because it gets people thinking about something specific. Plus it sets a good vibe right from the start. Most people are happy to share something small, and it naturally leads to follow-up questions.</p>

          <h2 id="dinner-anyone">2. "If you could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, who would it be?"</h2>

          <p>A classic for a reason. Everyone has a different answer, and you learn a lot about someone based on who they pick. Ask them why they chose that person and what they'd talk about.</p>

          <h2 id="last-binged">3. "What's the last thing you binged?"</h2>

          <p>Could be a show, YouTube channel, podcast, or even a food. People love talking about stuff they're currently into, and you might get some good recommendations out of it.</p>

          <h2 id="unpopular-opinion">4. "What's your unpopular opinion?"</h2>

          <p>This one cuts right through the small talk. People love sharing their hot takes on movies, food, music, whatever. Just be ready for some spicy answers and try not to turn it into an argument.</p>

          <h2 id="instant-expert">5. "If you could instantly become an expert in something, what would it be?"</h2>

          <p>More interesting than asking about hobbies because it gets at what people wish they could do. You get a mix of practical answers (languages, instruments) and wild ones (sword fighting, lock picking).</p>

          <h2 id="weirdest-thing">6. "What's the weirdest thing that happened to you this week?"</h2>

          <p>Everyone has weird moments they don't usually get to talk about. This gives them a chance to tell a story, which is way more engaging than just answering questions back and forth.</p>

          <h2 id="teleport-anywhere">7. "Where would you go right now if you could teleport anywhere?"</h2>

          <p>Some people say a beach, others say home, others say somewhere completely random. The answer tells you a lot about what they're feeling or what they care about. Good for follow-up questions too.</p>

          <h2 id="looking-forward">8. "What's something you're looking forward to?"</h2>

          <p>Keeps things positive and gives you insight into their life. Could be something big like a trip or something small like the weekend. Either way, people like talking about things they're excited about.</p>

          <h2 id="school-skill">9. "What's a skill you wish everyone learned in school?"</h2>

          <p>Gets into interesting territory about education and life skills. You'll hear everything from "how to do taxes" to "how to have difficult conversations." Most people have opinions on this.</p>

          <h2 id="decompress">10. "What's your go-to activity when you need to decompress?"</h2>

          <p>Better than just asking about hobbies because it connects what they do to how they feel. You learn about their interests and their stress relief strategies at the same time.</p>

          <h2>Some Quick Tips</h2>

          <p>Don't just ask questions and move on. Actually listen to their answers and ask follow-up questions. Share your own answer too so it feels like a real conversation instead of an interview.</p>

          <p>If someone gives you a short answer and doesn't seem interested, don't force it. Try a different topic or just accept that this chat might not go anywhere. That happens.</p>

          <p>And don't run through these like a checklist. Pick one that feels natural for the moment and let the conversation go wherever it goes. The opener is just a starting point.</p>
